# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.

# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/sherpa-onnx-kws-zipformer-gigaspeech-3.3M-2024-01-01/
    - assets/sherpa-onnx-punct-ct-transformer-zh-en-vocab272727-2024-04-12/

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a

  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: SourceHanSansCN
      fonts:

        - asset: assets/fonts/SourceHanSansCN/SourceHanSansCN-Normal.otf
          weight: 300
  #   - family: Schyler
